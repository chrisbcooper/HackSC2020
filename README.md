# YogaBear
Our app allows users to attempt yoga poses and compares their forms with those of professionals. It then tracks their progression to help them improve. We built it using the always AI pose estimation API to compare a live video to a person in a picture. We were able to get a working Python server and design an algorithm to compare the skeleton of a human in a live video frame to someone in a picture.
